The vanilla version of deontic arrays relies on what could be called \\\"counterfactual cross-validation,\\\" which goes as follows. If in a completely sandboxed environment with only one output bit we temporarily discard part of the charter, is the model prevented from violating those anyways thanks to the remaining principles redundantly making up for them?
