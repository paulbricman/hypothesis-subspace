This is the root note of a tree-shaped document which contains my work at [Refine](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/D7epkkJb3CqDTYgX9/refine-an-incubator-for-conceptual-alignment-research-bets), an incubator for conceptual research on alignment hosted by [Conjecture](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jfq2BH5kfQqu2vYv3/we-are-conjecture-a-new-alignment-research-startup). I'm using this fellowship as an opportunity to explore several prosaic themes which I currently find promising, and get better at the poking process itself.

Reading all depth-one theme notes should take you around five minutes â€” a deliberate design choice to help you get a quick sense of what this is all about. Afterwards, I recommend switching to a depth-first traversal on whatever branch you find interesting. Also, if you're interested in meta-science rather than object-level notes, consider having a look at the appendix.

**I'd find it extremely helpful to hear any targeted feedback you might have via the note-linked comment threads. If possible, consider phrasing it as leading questions which I can then turn into new branches from the note you're commenting on. Best viewed on desktop.**
