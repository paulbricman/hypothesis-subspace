# Physicalist Fluency

What if we try to go as close as possible to human values and bypass language? First, learn a neural interlingua by training an auxiliary model to translate across all neuroimaging modalities currently available and forcing a compact bottleneck layer. Second, condition the whole internal state of the main model to be translatable to and from the neural interlingua. This should generally ensure that human representations and human representations alone are employed by the model in its internal thought process, by constraining it to what human brains are fluent in. Third, as a slider of capability, gradually shift towards relaxing the translatability constrain by applying it to model shards only, rather than holistically. This is analogous to a team of developers working on a codebase, where each one is only responsible for a chunk of it. The codebase is still represented in human brains, but no single brain represents it.
