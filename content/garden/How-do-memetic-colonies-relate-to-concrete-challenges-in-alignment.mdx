# How do memetic colonies relate to concrete challenges in alignment?

Memetic colonies might help us define an optimization target which captures our normative beliefs while being robust to both unprecedented situations (e.g. novel capabilities) and paradigm shifts (e.g. a major future change in the seed normative framework). At the same time, they might help alleviate acausal blackmail by penalizing the fitness of memeplexes which are compatible with such thought patterns. In this, memetic colonies attempt to implement a mechanism for coherent extrapolation of volition. In different terms, memetic colonies aim to implement the True Name of a given normative framework through memetic modeling.
