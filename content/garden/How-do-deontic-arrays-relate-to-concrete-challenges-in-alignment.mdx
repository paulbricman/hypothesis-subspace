# How do deontic arrays relate to concrete challenges in alignment?

Deontic arrays might help provide a means of specifying a deontological framework in a way compatible with the prosaic requirement of end-to-end differentiation. Through built-in methods of strategically expanding the associated "charter" of normative principles, deontic arrays might also be resilient to the quirks of the seed deontology, and instead infer the underlying spirit of the law. In this, they provide an optimization target which can be composed with other objectives (e.g. by simple weighting).
