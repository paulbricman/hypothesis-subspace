# How do symbiont sandboxes relate to concrete challenges in alignment?

Symbiont sandboxes themselves do not offer concrete technical tricks for helping with alignment.

They might indirectly help find strategies for making agents coexist (e.g. by interweaving objectives, by adding mediators to destabilize Nash equilibria, etc.).
